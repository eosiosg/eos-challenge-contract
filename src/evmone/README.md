> Fast Ethereum Virtual Machine implementation

_evmone_ is a C++ implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). 
Created by members of the [Ewasm] team, the project aims for clean, standalone EVM implementation 
that can be imported as an execution module by Ethereum Client projects. 
The codebase of _evmone_ is optimized to provide fast and efficient execution of EVM smart contracts.

#### Characteristic of evmone

1. Exposes the [EVMC] API.
2. The _indirect call threading_ is the dispatch method used -
   a loaded EVM program is a table with pointers to functions implementing virtual instructions.
3. The gas cost and stack requirements of block of instructions is precomputed 
   and applied once per block during execution.
4. The [intx] library is used to provide 256-bit integer precision.
5. The [ethash] library is used to provide Keccak hash function implementation
   needed for the special `SHA3` instruction.
6. Requires C++17 standard.

## Usage

### As geth plugin

evmone implements the [EVMC] API for Ethereum Virtual Machines.
It can be used as a plugin replacing geth's internal EVM. But for that a modified
version of geth is needed. The [Ewasm]'s fork
of go-ethereum provides [binary releases of geth with EVMC support](https://github.com/ewasm/go-ethereum/releases).

Next, download evmone from [Releases].

Start the downloaded geth with `--vm.evm` option pointing to the evmone shared library.

```bash
geth --vm.evm=./libevmone.so
```

### Building from source
To build the evmone EVMC module (shared library), test, and benchmark:

1. Clone the repo and create a ```build``` directory:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ethereum/evmone
cd evmone
mkdir build
cd build
```

2. Build dependencies and (on Windows) generate a Visual Studio solution, then build the source:
#### Linux / OSX
```
cmake .. -DEVMONE_TESTING=ON
cmake --build . -- -j
```

#### Windows
*Note: >= Visual Studio 2017 is required since EVMOne makes heavy use of C++17*
* **Visual Studio 2017**: ```cmake .. -DEVMONE_TESTING=ON -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"```
* **Visual Studio 2019**: ```cmake .. -DEVMONE_TESTING=ON -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64```
```
cmake --build .
```

3. Run the unit tests or benchmarking tool:
```
bin/evmone-unittests
bin/evmone-bench
```
### Tools

#### evm-test

The **evm-test** executes a collection of unit tests on 
any EVMC-compatible Ethereum Virtual Machine implementation.
The collection of tests comes from the evmone project.

```bash
evm-test ./evmone.so
```

### Docker

Docker images with evmone are available on Docker Hub:
https://hub.docker.com/r/ethereum/evmone.

Having the evmone shared library inside a docker is not very useful on its own,
but the image can be used as the base of another one or you can run benchmarks 
with it.

```bash
docker run --entrypoint evmone-bench ethereum/evmone /src/test/benchmarks
```
